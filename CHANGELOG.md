## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- A symlink that stays inside the workspace works again. v1.2.0 refused any
  `path` whose final component was a symlink, so `card.svg -> real/card.svg` —
  workspace-relative, exactly what the input documents, and accepted before
  v1.2.0 — started failing for no security gain. A symlink is now
  followed to the end of its chain and judged by where it lands, the same
  containment test v1.2.0 already applied to parent directories. What v1.2.0
  closed stays closed: a target outside the workspace, a symlinked parent
  directory, and a chain whose last hop leaves the workspace are all refused,
  as is a cycle.

### Changed
- Every `uses:` example across the six README translations now pins `@v1.2.1`.
  They still pointed at `@v1.1.0`, so a reader copying the documented example
  ran the version from before the path-containment work.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-13

### Security
- The `path` input is now confined to the workspace. It was documented as a
  workspace-relative filename, but nothing enforced that: the value went
  straight into `mkdir -p`, the generator's `--output`, and `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`.
  `path: /etc/x.svg` and `path: ../../../x.svg` wrote outside the workspace.
  Absolute paths, paths that climb out with `..`, and paths whose deepest
  existing parent resolves outside the workspace are refused, as is a final
  component that is itself a symlink — a purely lexical check could not see
  `escape -> /tmp/outside`, through which `escape/card.svg` landed at
  `/tmp/outside/card.svg`.
- A line break in `path` can no longer inject step outputs. `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`
  is newline-delimited, so a value containing a newline used to declare
  arbitrary extra outputs that anything reading `steps.*.outputs` would trust.
  These matter most when `path` is fed from workflow context rather than typed
  by hand.

### Fixed
- Path splitting no longer performs pathname expansion. An unquoted `set -- $raw`
  globs as well as splits, so with matching files alongside, `README.*` became
  `README.md/README.txt` and `[a]card.svg` became `acard.svg` — valid Unix
  filenames rewritten according to whatever happened to sit next to them.

### Added
- The resolved output path is logged. Normalisation can rewrite what was asked
  for, and this is the value that reaches the `path` output.
- The repository's first CI: shellcheck, a syntax check, and path-input tests on
  `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest`. Until now `index.sh` — the entire action —
  was never executed by any check before a consumer ran it. The macOS leg is not
  redundant: its `/bin/bash` is 3.2, and it caught a bash-4-only construct on its
  first run.

### Changed
- `outputs.path` reports the normalised path, so `./profile/x.svg` comes back as
  `profile/x.svg`.

### Upgrading
A workflow that passed an absolute path, a path climbing out of the workspace,
or a path through a symlink pointing outside it will now fail instead of writing
outside the workspace. The documented contract has always been a
workspace-relative filename. Note that the `v1` alias moves with this release,
so consumers pinned to `@v1` receive this automatically.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- `LICENSE`. All six README translations had claimed MIT since v1.0.0, but the
  repository shipped no licence text at all, leaving consumers without the
  permission the documentation granted them. The text matches
  `soulteary/github-profile-trophy-action` byte for byte.

### Fixed
- `outputs.path` is now actually exposed. The output was declared in
  `action.yml`, but a composite action only publishes an output when the output
  declares a `value:` and the producing step declares an `id:` — neither was
  present. `index.sh` duly wrote `path=` to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`, but nothing read
  it, so the output was the empty string for every consumer of v1.0.0.
- The `version` input's description claimed "Defaults to latest" while the
  default is `v1.0.0`. The default is deliberate — pinning the upstream binary
  keeps an upstream release from silently changing this action's behaviour — so
  the description was corrected and the value left alone. `latest` remains
  available as an opt-in.
- The SVG sanity check only ever inspected line 1 of the generated file. The
  upstream generator writes a leading blank line and indents the root element,
  so `<svg` lands on line 2 and the check matched none of the 26 artifacts this
  action produced — the warning fired on every successful run. It now scans the
  head of the file, matches `<svg` rather than the bare word `svg` (an error
  body merely mentioning SVG used to pass), and reports the first non-blank
  line instead of the blank one. It remains a warning, not a hard failure.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- Initial release: generate GitHub Readme Stats cards (`stats`, `top-langs`,
  `pin`, `wakatime`, `gist`) in a workflow by downloading the upstream Go
  binary, with query-string or JSON options, a configurable output path, and
  six translated READMEs.

## Upgrade notes for 1.1.0

`outputs.path` changing from always-empty to populated is a behaviour change,
not a pure fix. A workflow that branches on it will take a different path:

| Expression | v1.0.0 | v1.1.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `steps.<id>.outputs.path == ''` | always true | false once a card is written |
| `steps.<id>.outputs.path != ''` | always false | true once a card is written |
| `steps.<id>.outputs.path` (truthy) | always false | true once a card is written |

The second and third rows are the ones to check before upgrading: a step that
has silently never run will start running.
